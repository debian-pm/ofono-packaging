Description: Mobile telephony stack (daemon)
 oFono is a stack for mobile telephony devices on Linux.  oFono supports
 speaking to telephony devices through specific drivers, or with generic
 AT commands.
 .
 oFono also includes a low-level plug-in API for integrating with other
 telephony stacks, cellular modems and storage back-ends. The plug-in API
 functionality is modeled on public standards, in particular
 3GPP TS 27.007 "AT command set for User Equipment (UE)."
 .
 This package includes the core daemon.
